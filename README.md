### What is ESP32 and ESC?

- **ESP32**: The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is commonly used in IoT applications, robotics, and smart devices for wireless communication and control. [Click me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32)
- **ESC**: An Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) is a device used to regulate the speed, direction, and braking of brushless motors in drones, RC vehicles, and other motor-driven systems. [Click me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_speed_control)
